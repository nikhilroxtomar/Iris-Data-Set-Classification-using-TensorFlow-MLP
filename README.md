Iris Data Set is one of the basic data set to begin your path towards Neural Networks. Today Neural Network is one of the most trending machine learning algorithms, as they perform really well then any other algorithms in the field of machine learning. So everyone should begin learning about neural network. If you want to learn, then this is the right place for you.
